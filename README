Reconnoiter's goal is to better the world of monitoring by marrying fault
detection and trending together. Through ease of configuration and ongoing
maintenance, Reconnoiter encourages monitoring important technical metrics
along side critical business metrics to improve awareness and ultimately
accountability.

Reconnoiter? Who names this stuff? Honestly?

Development at this point is pretty rapid. As such, decisions are made that
might cause what we call a "flag-day". A flag-day is when an upgrade through a
specific version will prevent some functionality between that version and an
older version. Commits that do this (like a change in protocol) will be marked
as "flag-day" commits and note the system components that must be lock-step
upgraded. Review flag-day commits.

Specific (significant) upgrade notes.

Installation can be a bit tricky, it might help to look at this step-by-step
guide to installing on Debian.
