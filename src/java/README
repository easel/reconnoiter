Esper is GPL'd, other bits dependencies are Apache-2.0 licensed.
This is all so confusing.

As far as I can tell there is no way to be actually compliant with this
license -- even with no code changes.  Apache commons isn't GPLd, but
I need bits of that.  They run in the same VM, so that's a mess.

Anyway, we'll GPL everything we write in Java just to be on the safe
side.
