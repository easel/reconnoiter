Tables are in tables/, stored procedures/functions are in sprocs/

The scaffolding.sql file is used to glue them all together in the right order?
Convoluted? perhaps.  It allows us to manipulate small sections of the schema
as code, stored in version control, and reconstitute the database easily for
testing.
